# Footwork

Footwork is a JavaScript roguelike (or, it will be). It is built using
[rot.js](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js) by Ondrej Zara and
[sprintf.js](https://github.com/alexei/sprintf.js) by Alexandry
Marasteanu, and is based on the excellent
[tutorial](http://www.codingcookies.com/2013/04/01/building-a-roguelike-in-javascript-part-1/)
by Dominic Charley-Roy.

It is a traditional roguelike in some ways, with ASCII graphics, lots
of commands and so forth, with the exception that it will have
FPS-like controls (mouse controls direction, keys control walking) and
a combat system "inspired" by Sil and Dark Souls (not necessarily like
either). This probably makes it not that traditional at all, really.

The present aim is a proof of concept of the combat system, to see if
it's fun or just a pain in the arse to control. If it seems fun, I'll
try to turn it into a proper game.

## Playing the game

Footwork isn't hosted anywhere at the moment, but you can download the files
and open index.html in your favourite browser if you want to give it a
go.
