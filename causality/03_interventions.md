# A second answer: ideal interventions

WIP

Causation is an arrow
It is very simple to observe that we can represent causal statements with arrows. For example, “rain causes the footpath to be wet” could be represented by the diagram:
Drawing causal sentences as diagrams can be quite helpful in thinking about how multiple causal relationships operate together. For example, “rain causes the footpath to be wet and water on the footpath causes it to be slippery” could be drawn like this:
This diagram tells us two more things: first, rain usually makes footpaths slippery. Secondly, if we can prevent the footpath from becoming wet, it won’t become slippery even if it does rain. We can conclude these facts from the sentence as well, but once you learn how to read graphs like this it is easier to do so from the graph, especially when the number of causal relationships grows large.
Note that “causes are arrows” can help to determine the consequences of some causal relationships that you already know, but on its own it cannot help you work out if there is or isn’t a causal relationship if you’re unsure in the first place.


The “comparison between possible worlds” approach to causality invites you to imagine two worlds that are as similar as possible, except in one world (for example) the bolognese had chili in it and in the other it didn’t. A rather different way of defining causal effects is to say that “chili causes bolognese to be hot” means “if I add chili to bolognese, it will become hot”.
This is, to me, much more intuitive than the counterfactual account. Instead of trying to understand the unusual idea of “most similar possible worlds”, I can instead think about what I expect to be the consequences of my actions — which is already something that I do all the time. On the other hand, it makes causation depend on my own actions. Does “wind causes flags to flutter” mean “if I create the wind, flags will flutter”? It seems to me that wind causes flags to flutter whether or not there is anybody creating said wind.
The counterfactual theory uses the idea of parallel worlds to guide our intuition, but employs the concept of “minimally different worlds” to provide a strict definition of causal relationships. Similarly, while the notion of taking an action can give us a general idea of the interventional theory, a more thorough definition depends on the idea of ideal interventions. If, while adding chili to my bolognese, I also throw in a squirt of dish detergent, it would be wrong to say that the chili was the cause of its frothy appearance. Ideal interventions are interventions that don’t have such side-effects.
Ideal interventions might also help with the question of what it means to say “wind causes flags to flutter”. Instead of asking “if someone creates the wind, flags will flutter” we can say “if an ideal intervention switches the wind on, flags will flutter”. I can’t really tell if this is a satisfactory resolution or not.
Also, just as the counterfactual theory has problems with explaining what it actually means for two worlds to be similar, the interventional theory has problems explaining just what an ideal intervention is.
