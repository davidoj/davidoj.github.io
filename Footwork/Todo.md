## Control, Attack, Defense

Not convinced the current system is good; a bit unintuitive, odd random falls due to movement. Not sure how to make it better, though.

Ideas:

### No balance loss for turning

	* Makes direction somewhat non-meaningful as-is.
		** May be remedied by direction-specific abilities
		** Is mouse needed for direction? Need keys for step, spin and strafe. Reduced modifiers available
			due to browser use


### Click to move

	* Interacts well with mouse-to-face
	* Good way to travel
	* Multiple ways to control seems a bit inelegant

### Attacking and defending

Need abilities to make it interesting:

	* Shield bearers: always protected from one direction
	* Set parry: protect from a particular direction; costs 1 balance to move
	* Charge: move and attack in same turn; costs 3 balance

Balance costs for tactical engagements
