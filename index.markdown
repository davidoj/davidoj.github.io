# Seeing and Doing

People have been trying for a long time to explain how it is that we learn causal relationships. There are a number of theories that try to explain when we can and cannot learn causal relationships. They all share a particular weakness, however: they are founded on vague principles. When I started working on my PhD, I was trying to find a way to characterise the difficulty of causal inference problems. The vagueness sitting under the available frameworks of causal inference made it very difficult to make any progress on this question - I couldn't define a prototypical causal inference problem and feel confident that I'd understood the assumptions I'd made in order to do so. I haven't yet found a way to characterise the difficulty of causal inference problems, but I have found a way to pose such problems while being explicit about all of the underlying assumptions. I call it *Causal Statistical Decision Theory* and this blog is to explain how it works.
