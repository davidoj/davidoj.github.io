# Three key questions about cause and effect

In this chapter, I talk a bit about the history of thought on causality. I'm very much an amateur on the history of this question, so there might be a few mistakes.

People have thinking for a very long time about causes and effects. We all have many clear ideas about some things being caused by others: wind makes flags flutter, rain makes the ground wet, watching sad movies makes me cry, chili makes food hot. I suspect that people have had similar ideas long before anyone began philosophical investigations of causality. Somewhere around 400 BC, Plato believed that the most important task for science and philosophy was to discover the causes of everything - he wrote ["inquiry into nature" consisted in a search for "the causes of each thing[...]"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/). Plato identified *knowledge of causes and effects* as a particularly important kind of knowledge. Following this line of thinking, his student Aristotle reasoned that, if discovering causes is so important, then surely it would be useful to understand of what causes are. Aristotle took up this challenge by developing a theory of four types of cause (that you can read about [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/)), three of which appear to me to be things that we would no longer use the word "causes" for, but instead might be described as something like constituent parts, definitions and purposes. The fourth kind of cause, called the *efficient cause* by Aristotle, seems to be something like what we call a cause today. However, renaming causes to efficient causes tells us very little about what causes are. It's easy to offer synynoms for the word "cause" - "wind causes flags to flutter" means "wind makes flags flutter" means "wind gives rise to flags fluttering" means (something similar to) "the wind is responsible for the flag fluttering", but these synonyms don't give us a useful theory of causation. Aristotle was correct that "*what does it mean for something to cause something else?*" is an important question to raise, but we'll have to keep looking for an adequate answer.

In the 18th century, the Scottish philosopher David Hume made many [advances in our understanding of causality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau). Like Aristotle, I think of one of Hume's key contributions was in asking new questions about causality. Like many of his predecessors, Hume was interested in Aristole's question of what causes are. He also realised that the answer to this first question was closely related to the answer to a second question: *how do we learn that something causes something else?*. Hume was also able to offer part of an answer to this question: however we learn about causes, our experience of the world must play a role. This conclusion follows from two premises: first, we cannot deduce from logic or pure mathematics alone that wind makes flags flutter or that chili makes food hot. Second, [all knowledge comes either from logic and pure mathematics or from experience of the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_fork). Together, this implies that our knowledge of the causal relationships must come, at least partly, from our experience of the world. Whatever causal relationships are, they must have some constituent part that is derivable from experience. This really does tell us something about causal relationships that goes beyond invoking synonyms, though we still want to know which component of causal relationships is derived from experience, how exactly we can learn this part and which other components causal relationships might have.

Hume had answers to these further questions as well. He claimed that (I think) that causal relationships have three components: an observed association, an assumption of regularity and the idea of a necessary connection. The thing we derive from experience is the observed association. For example, I might observe that flags flutter when winds are blowing and they do not flutter when no wind is blowing. I may assume that this is a *regular* pattern in the sense that I expect to observe the same association in the future that I have already observed. Putting the observation and the assumption together, I have a "rule of association": in general, flags flutter when and only when the wind is blowing. Rules of association still aren't causal relationships, though. I can also observe that people who are very good at basketball often buy large shirts, and I can assume that similar people will continue to buy similarly large shirts in the future. It doesn't follow that basketball skill causes people to have a taste for large shirts, even though we have both an observed association and an assumption of regularity. My understanding of Hume's thought here is particularly poor, but I think he roughly proposed that there was a third component to causal relations that he called "the idea of a necessary connection". This addition still leaves our question not completely answered - if a causal relationship is a "rule of association" along with an idea of necessary connection, then how do we learn this last idea? Is it also derived from experience by some other means, or is it to be taken from first principles reasoning?

Even though it's still somewhat vague, there's a bit more insight we can derive from this breakdown of causal relationships. The point that causal relationships have some "extra component" beyond rules of association is agreed upon by just about [every](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/why-ch1.pdf) [modern](https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198235070.001.0001/acprof-9780198235071-chapter-3) [scholar](http://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/215-S12/price-menzies-cause-as-secondary-quality.pdf) of [causality](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.839.2664&rep=rep1&type=pdf), even if the nature of the extra part is not so widely agreed upon. Rather than asking what this extra component could be, consider: *what could be the point of this extra component?*

Another interesting proposition of Hume's was that causal relationships were an *idea*. I'm not familiar enough with Hume's work to know what he really meant by this, but I think it is interesting to consider the possibility that associations are properties *of the world* while causal relationships are properties *of our minds*. If I was analysing this concept thoroughly I think I'd want a more precise way to capture the difference between association and causation, but, as an image, thinking of association as being "out there" while causation is "in my head" comes close to capturing what I think is a very important distinction. I believe that causal relationships really are some extra kind of thing we carry in our heads that can't be reduced to an observable property of the world in the way associations can.

This raises the the third key question about causal learning: *why are our minds built to learn causal relationships?*. If causal relationships cannot be reduced to a property of the world we observe (which is just a hypothesis at this stage), then it seems reasonable to conclude that we do not learn causal relationships in order to describe our observations. For what purpose, then, do we learn them? [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html), a contemporary researcher in causality, has proposed two purposes for causal knowledge that go beyond describing observations:
 
 1. Knowledge of causal relationships helps us decide how to act; if I want my food to be hot, it is helpful to know that adding chili will make it so
 2. Knowledge of causal relationships helps us decide who to blame; if I don't like my food to be hot, perhaps I should look for whoever put chili in it

It is my view, as I discuss in [chapter 4](/causality/04_consequences) and [chapter 5](/causality/05_see_do), that we should start by understanding how we can decide to act and how we can decide who to blame, and that the answers to this question will in turn shed light on the other key questions of how we can learn about causes and what causes are to begin with.
