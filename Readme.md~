# Footwork

Footwork is a JavaScript roguelike (or, it will be). At present, it's
intended to be pretty traditional with ASCII graphics, lots of
commands and so forth, with the exception that it will have FPS-like
controls (mouse controls direction, keys control walking) and a combat
system inspired by Sil and Dark Souls. Which probably makes it not
that traditional at all, really.

It's not hosted anywhere at the moment, but you can download the files
and open index.html in your favourite browser if you want to give it a
go.
