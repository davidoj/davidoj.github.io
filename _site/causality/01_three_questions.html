<p>People have thinking for a very long time about causes and effects. We all have many clear ideas about some things being caused by others: wind makes flags flutter, rain makes the ground wet, watching sad movies makes me cry, chili makes food hot. I suspect that people have had similar ideas long before anyone began philosophical investigations of causality. Somewhere around 400 BC, Plato believed that the most important task for science and philosophy was to discover the causes of everything - he wrote <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/">“inquiry into nature” consisted in a search for “the causes of each thing[…]”</a>. Plato identified <em>knowledge of causes and effects</em> as a particularly important kind of knowledge. Following this line of thinking, his student Aristotle reasoned that, if discovering causes is so important, then surely it would be useful to understand of what causes are. Aristotle took up this challenge by developing a theory of four types of cause (that you can read about <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/">here</a>), three of which appear to me to be things that we would no longer use the word “causes” for, but instead might be described as something like constituent parts, definitions and purposes. The fourth kind of cause, called the <em>efficient cause</em> by Aristotle, seems to be something like what we call a cause today. However, renaming causes to efficient causes tells us very little about what causes are. It’s easy to offer synynoms for the word “cause” - “wind causes flags to flutter” means “wind makes flags flutter” means “wind gives rise to flags fluttering” means (something similar to) “the wind is responsible for the flag fluttering”, but these synonyms don’t give us a useful theory of causation. Aristotle was correct that “<em>what does it mean for something to cause something else?</em>” is an important question to raise, but we’ll have to keep looking for an adequate answer.</p>

<p>In the 18th century, the Scottish philosopher David Hume made many <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau">advances in our understanding of causality</a>. Like Aristotle, I think of one of Hume’s key contributions was in asking new questions about causality. Like many of his predecessors, Hume was interested in Aristole’s question of what causes are. He also realised that the answer to this first question was closely related to the answer to a second question: <em>how do we learn that something causes something else?</em>. Hume was also able to offer part of an answer to this question: however we learn about causes, our experience of the world must play a role. This conclusion follows from two premises: first, we cannot deduce from logic or pure mathematics alone that wind makes flags flutter or that chili makes food hot. Second, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hume%27s_fork">all knowledge comes either from logic and pure mathematics or from experience of the world</a>. Together, this implies that our knowledge of the causal relationships must come, at least partly, from our experience of the world. Whatever causal relationships are, they must have some constituent part that is derivable from experience. This really does tell us something about causal relationships that goes beyond invoking synonyms, though we still want to know which component of causal relationships is derived from experience, how exactly we can learn this part and which other components causal relationships might have.</p>

<p>Hume had answers to these further questions as well. He claimed that (I think) that causal relationships have three components: an observed association, an assumption of regularity and the idea of a necessary connection. The thing we derive from experience is the observed association. For example, I might observe that flags flutter when winds are blowing and they do not flutter when no wind is blowing. I may assume that this is a <em>regular</em> pattern in the sense that I expect to observe the same association in the future that I have already observed. Putting the observation and the assumption together, I have a “rule of association”: in general, flags flutter when and only when the wind is blowing. Rules of association still aren’t causal relationships, though. I can also observe that people who are very good at basketball often buy large shirts, and I can assume that similar people will continue to buy similarly large shirts in the future. It doesn’t follow that basketball skill causes people to have a taste for large shirts, even though we have both an observed association and an assumption of regularity. My understanding of Hume’s thought here is particularly poor, but I think he roughly proposed that there was a third component to causal relations that he called “the idea of a necessary connection”. This addition still leaves our question not completely answered - if a causal relationship is a “rule of association” along with an idea of necessary connection, then how do we learn this last idea? Is it also derived from experience by some other means, or is it to be taken from first principles reasoning?</p>

<p>Even though it’s still somewhat vague, there’s a bit more insight we can derive from this breakdown of causal relationships. The point that causal relationships have some “extra component” beyond rules of association is agreed upon by just about <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/WHY/why-ch1.pdf">every</a> <a href="https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/0198235070.001.0001/acprof-9780198235071-chapter-3">modern</a> <a href="http://web.mit.edu/bskow/www/215-S12/price-menzies-cause-as-secondary-quality.pdf">scholar</a> of <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.839.2664&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf">causality</a>, even if the nature of the extra part is not so widely agreed upon. Think about this question: <em>what could be the point of learning causal relationships?</em> Because causal relationships are more than rules of association, we cannot learn causal relationships just to describe what we have seen in the past and what we expect to see in the future, because rules of association are enough to do this. If there is any purpose at all to learning causal relationships (and I suspect there is), it must go beyond description and prediction.</p>

<p>It seems to be reasonably easy to answer the question of purpose. <a href="http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html">Judea Pearl</a>, a contemporary researcher in causality, has proposed two purposes for causal knowledge that go beyond describing observations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Knowledge of causal relationships helps us decide how to act; if I want my food to be hot, it is helpful to know that adding chili will make it so</li>
  <li>Knowledge of causal relationships helps us decide who (or what) to blame; if I don’t like my food to be hot, perhaps I should look for whoever put chili in it</li>
</ol>

<p>The approach I pursue in <a href="/causality/04_consequences">chapter 4</a> and <a href="/causality/05_see_do">chapter 5</a> is to develop a generic theory of deciding how to act that is completely agnostic about causation, which is what I call <em>Causal Statistical Decision Theory</em> (CSDT). We obviously do need to decide how to act, so a good theory of how we can do this will be a useful thing regardless of what it has to say about causation. It may also help us to understand causation. Here’s how that might happen: As it turns out, the “generic theory of deciding” ends up being made up of two parts: rules of association and consequence of actions. Causal relationships, which serve the purpose of helping us decide how to act, have two parts: rules of association and <em>something else</em>. So we have two different things - theories of deciding and theories of causation - that have the same purpose (helping us make decisions), share one part (rules of associations) and both have exactly one extra part, which in one case is somewhat mysterious. I think we could at least speculate that these are actually two different ways of looking at the same thing. In order to understand CSDT, and how it might relate to causation, it helps to understand more about modern theories of what causation is, which is what I introduce in <a href="/causality/02_counterfactuals">chapter 2</a>.</p>

<h2 id="addendum">Addendum</h2>

<p>In this chapter, I talked a bit about the history of thought on causality. I’m very much an amateur on the history of this question, so there might be a few mistakes.</p>

<p>The summary of Hume omits a great deal of his work on questions relating to causality, the <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau">link provided in the text</a> gives much more on this question.</p>
