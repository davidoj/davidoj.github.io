# Three key questions about cause and effect

In this chapter, I talk a bit about the history of thought on causality. I'm very much an amateur on the history of this question, so there might be a few mistakes.

People have thinking for a very long time about causes and effects. We all have many clear ideas about some things being caused by others: wind makes flags flutter, rain makes the ground wet, watching sad movies makes me cry, chili makes food hot. While I have no evidence to back this up, I suspect that people have had similar ideas long before anyone began philosophical investigations of causality. Somewhere around 400 BC, Plato believed that the most important task for science and philosophy was to discover the causes of everything - he wrote that ["inquiry into nature" consisted in a search for "the causes of each thing[...]"](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/). By saying this, he identified *knowledge of causes and effects* as a particularly important kind of knowledge. His student Aristotle reasoned that, if discovering causes is so important, then surely it would be useful to understand of what causes are. Aristotle developed a theory of four types of cause (that you can read about [here](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-causality/)), three of which appear to me to be things that we would no longer use the word "causes" for, but instead might be described as something like constituent parts, definitions and purposes. He also argued that if we want to explain something, we should explain it in terms of its *purpose* rather than its *causes*. While he raised the question *what does it mean for something to cause something else?*, which still remains relevant today, he appears to have left the answer wide open.

In the 18th century, the Scottish philosopher David Hume made many [advances in our understanding of causality](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/#Cau). One of these advances was, like Aristotle, introducing a new question to consider: *how do we learn that something causes something else?* Recall Plato's proposition that discovering causes is the fundamental goal of scientific and philosophical inquiry. As Aristotle proposed, understanding what causes are will surely help us to discover them. However, even if we don't know exactly what they are, understanding how we learn them could also help us to discover causes. It might also help us to better understand what causes are to begin with.

Hume's answer to the question of how we learn causes is also worth considering. He proposed that, however we learn about causes, our experience of the world must play a role. He argued that we cannot deduce from logic or pure mathematics alone that wind makes flags flutter or that chili makes food hot. If our knowledge comes either from logic and pure mathematics or from experience of the world, then our knowledge of the causal relationships I've mentioned must therefore come, at least in part, from our experience of wind, flags, chili and food. This is an important step to take, as it focuses our inquiry about causation on the relationship between observation and causality. It turns out that this relationship is itself puzzling, and continues to be a puzzle today.

As I understand it, Hume's own view was that the process of learning about causal effects as had two parts. The first part of learning a cause was to observe an association, and assumeg that this association will continue into the future. For example, we can learn that “wind is asociated with flags fluttering” by observing flags fluttering when winds are blowing, and assuming that they will continue to flutter in the future when winds blow. Unfortunately, this isn't enough to establish a causal relationhsip. I can also observe that people who are very good at basketball often buy large shirts, and I can reasonably assume that they will continue to do so in the future. It doesn't follow that basketball skill causes people to have a taste for large shirts, even though this satisfies Hume's criteria of association and regularity. Associations do seem to play a role in causal inferences - wind certainly *is* associated with fluttering flags - but even after we observe an association and suppose the future will be like the past, there is still some missing ingredient. Again, my understanding is shallow, but Hume seems to have proposed that a learned association becomes a causal relationship when we add to it the idea that there is a "necessary connection" between the two things happening. It is not clear how we are supposed to develop the idea that two things are causally connected - Hume describes the development of such ideas as a "mental habit", but this doesn't explain much.

Despite the fact that there still seems to be a missing ingredient in Hume's account of causal learning, he was correct to perceive that the question of how we learn about causes is an important one, and he did a good job of setting out what is clear - that association plays a role in how we learn these things - and that there is some mysterious "extra" idea or habit involved in learning causal relationships beyond association and regularity.

Another interesting proposition of Hume's was that causal relationships were an *idea*. I'm not familiar enough with Hume's work to know what he really meant by this, but I think it is interesting to consider the possibility that associations are properties *of the world* while causal relationships are properties *of our minds*. If I was analysing this concept thoroughly I think I'd want a more precise way to capture the difference between association and causation, but, as an image, thinking of association as being "out there" while causation is "in my head" comes close to capturing what I think is a very important distinction. I believe that causal relationships really are some extra kind of thing we carry in our heads that can't be reduced to an observable property of the world in the way associations can.

This raises the the third key question about causal learning: *why are our minds built to learn causal relationships?*. If causal relationships cannot be reduced to a property of the world we observe (which is just a hypothesis at this stage), then it seems reasonable to conclude that we do not learn causal relationships in order to describe our observations. For what purpose, then, do we learn them? [Judea Pearl](http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html), a contemporary researcher in causality, has proposed two purposes for causal knowledge that go beyond describing observations:
 
 1. Knowledge of causal relationships helps us decide how to act; if I want my food to be hot, it is helpful to know that adding chili will make it so
 2. Knowledge of causal relationships helps us decide who to blame; if I don't like my food to be hot, perhaps I should look for whoever put chili in it

It is my view, as I discuss in [chapter 4](/causality/04_consequences.md) and [chapter 5](/causality/05_see_do.md), that we should start by understanding how we can decide to act and how we can decide who to blame, and that the answers to this question will in turn shed light on the other key questions of how we can learn about causes and what causes are to begin with. I am amused by the fact that Aristotle may have approved of this line of thinking: to understand causes and effects, we have to start by understanding the purpose of causes and effects.
